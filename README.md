# TheMicroservicesJourney

My journey to center of the microservices.


 As i begin my journey to understand what it takes to create microservices in java (i am a c++ developer and java naturally was 
  the next closest to start of with), i document simple helloworld projects, which help me understand things better. 
  
  Most of the repositories here are carved or heavily inspired from online tutorials etc., but i try to write on my own in my favorite
  eclipse editor.
  
  I would list down here the repositories in the order i started writing.
  
  The very first thing i found quite fasicnating was Spring framework, (i know little of core-java) and thats where it all begins.
  
  I start with spring mvc and move on further in the direction wind takes me.
  
  
  1. https://github.com/samair/spring-mvc.git : This is a simple spring mvc project, which creates a restcontroller and showcases the use of basic servlets etc.
  
  2. https://github.com/samair/springboot.git : Once i understood the basics of spring, ofcourse only a thin part of mvc, i quickly deiced that i better change gears and hooked on to Spring boot. To my surprise writing application in spring boot is quite easy. If you are from Spring background, you will have a sigh of relief. A lot of boilerplate annotations go away, and you get to work on the real meat.
 
 This application is again a simple rest server, with multiple endpoints. Idea here is to understand how i can use spring boot.
 
 As a part of it, i used spring-data-cache, Redis in this case. It was too sleek and easy with few annotations.
 This tutorial helped me understadn the real deal -> https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cache-tutorial
 
 Then i was fascinated with the world of annotation, how easy life becomes with them and naturally wanted to write one. As a result i wrote a small annotations creator.
 
 3. https://github.com/samair/java_annotations.git : I heavily relied on a online tutorial in order to finish this as i had no idea of what reflection really meant. At the end of writing this project i got a hang of what reflection is and how it could be used.
 
 Now i have to get back to track, plan is to write another spring boot application , this time something with a bit of meat.

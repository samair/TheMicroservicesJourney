# TheMicroservicesJourney

My journey to center of the microservices.

- Pre
  As i begin my journey to understand what it takes to create microservices in java (i am a c++ developer and java naturally was 
  the next closest to start of with), i document simple helloworld projects, which help me understand things better. 
  
  Most of the repositories here are carved or heavily inspired from online tutorials etc., but i try to write on my own in my favorite
  eclipse editor.
  
  I would list down here the repositories in the order i started writing.
  
  The very first thing i found quite fasicnating was Spring framework, (i know little of core-java) and thats where it all begins.
  
  I start with spring mvc and move on further as the wind takes me.
